# The Clustering Analysis toolbox for cell-class identification

The Clustering Analysis (MATLAB / GNU Octave) toolbox separates cell classes based on the characteristics of extracellularly recorded action potential (AP) waveforms and the properties of the firing pattern. This toolbox was developed and is maintained by Salva Ardid PhD.

The code reproduces Figures 3-6 of the paper: *"Ardid, Vinck, Kaping, Marquez, Everling, Womelsdorf (2014) Mapping of functionally characterized cell classes onto canonical circuit operations in primate prefrontal cortex"*, currently under review.

Should you find the toolbox interesting, please try it in your data. Just ensure that any publication using this code properly cites the original manuscript and links to this repository:
